		  Our inspiration came from our interest in music and its close relationship with shmoods (moods).  Everyone knows how an angry banger can help you blow of steam, or a sad ballad can help force out those much needed tears. This gave us the idea to develop something that allows us, and all users, to generate a playlist of songs based on your current shmood or desired shmood. To appeal to a broad audience, we wanted our music to be diverse, yet filled with quality so we tried targeted a public dataset of popular songs. We found a BillBoard Hot 100 dataset on Kaggle (thanks to to Kaylin Pavlik, walkerkq on GitHub). This dataset was generated by scraping Wikipedia for each Billboard Year-End Hot 100 songs over the last 50 years and subsequently scraping lyrics from metrolyics.com, songlyrics.com, and lyricsmode.com. 
			We went through the dataset and manually assigned 428 songs to a shmood.  The 5 all-encompassing shmoods we used were: Love, Dance, Sad, Angry and Saucy. The shmoods assigned were based strictly on lyrics and did not include considerations for other song components like rhythm, melody, or beat.  We then performed some basic NLP pre-processing (tokenization, dropping stop words) and applied TF-IDF word embedding to feed into a Multinomial Naive Bayes Model. Using our manually labelled songs as a training set, we used our model to generate “shmoods” for the remainder of the songs. Then based on the resulting classifications, a random selection of 11 songs is generated (different each time!) based on the mood the user selected!
